# 1. Write a program which prints “Hello World of Python”.
# word = input("Hello World of Python.")
# print(word)

# 2. Write a program which prints your personal information (person id, full name, contact address).
# name = input("name: Deeshri Thapa")
# address = input("contact address:+977 9813000000")
# print(name)
# print(address)

# 3. Write a program which accepts personal information and displays (person id, full name, contact address).
# id = input("enter your id:")
# name = input("enter your name:")
# address = input("enter your contact address:")
# print(id)
# print(name)
# print(address)

# 4. Write a program to print sum, difference, product, division, power of two numbers which input from the user.
# num1 = int(input("enter first number:"))
# num2 = int(input("enetr second number:"))
# sum = num1 + num2
# dif = num1 - num2
# product = num1 * num2
# div = num1/ num2
# power = num1 ** num2
# print("sum:", sum)
# print("difference:", dif)
# print("prodeuct:", product)
# print("division:", div)
# print("power:", power)

# 5. Write a program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
# fahrenheit = 54
# celsius = ((fahrenheit-32)*5)/9
# print("The temperature in celsius is :", celsius)

# 6.  Write a program to guess a number between 1 to 9.
# import random
# print(random.randint(1,9))
# print(random.random())

# 7. Write a program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.


# 8. Write a program to calculate simple interest.
# principal = 20
# rate = 35
# time =  40
# interest= (principal*rate*time)/100
# print("simple interest is :", interest)

# 9. Write a program to calculate compound interest.
# principle = 35
# rate= 15
# time = 20
# Amount = principle * (pow((1 + rate / 100), time))
# CI = Amount - principle
# print("Compound interest is", CI)
